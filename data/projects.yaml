  project: Developing a reliable platform for developers
  time:
    from: 05/2018
    to: now
  description: |
    For a German DIY retailer, having their own Kubernetes cluster was a big step
    forward for developer autonomy. It allows their digital unit to move faster
    than with a traditional enterprise IT setup, try out new ideas and launch product prototypes.

    By creating a reliable and reproducible setup, the infrastructure team gained
    more trust in stability and resilience of the platform. Using GitOps, all
    platform changes get reviewed and tested before automatically deploying them
    with their own CI/CD pipeline.

    For the developers, who hadn’t much experience with Kubernetes so far, we
    eased their deployment process by encapsulating all domain specific knowledge
    into Helm charts and custom tooling, so they can focus on writing software.
  tasks:
    - Analyzing of existing landscape and processes
    - Planning of new infrastructure components
    - Automation of infrastructure setup with Ansible and Helm
    - Creating and optimizing CI/CD pipelines for deveopers' ease of use
  techstack:
    - Ansible
    - GitLab
    - Helm
    - Kubernetes

    Optimizing existing workflows and general application setup improves product stability and eases the day-to-day work of development teams.
    I helped various clients:
  tasks:
    - Dockerizing their applications for parallel testing in build pipelines
    - Evaluating Kubernetes as foundation for a new PaaS
    - Defining their infrastructure as code with Ansible
    - Setting up monitoring with Prometheus
  techstack:
    - AWS
    - Ansible
    - Docker
    - GitLab
    - Helm
    - Kubernetes
    - Prometheus

  project: Digital transition from a classic enterprise environment to the cloud
  time:
    from: 03/2017
    to: 09/2017
  description: |
    How do you go from »release every couple of months« – still quite common in many large organizations – to much shorter iterations?
    And all while adopting cloud infrastructure as part of your IT stack?

    I helped designing and implementing best-practices for team-managed build pipelines and cluster resources on top of Kubernetes and AWS.
    They empower teams to work on their own release schedule, while updates and security fixes are automatically deployed from a central source.
  tasks:
    - Consulting regarding cloud setup and CI/CD pipeline
    - Software architecture and implementation
    - Microservice development
  techstack:
    - AWS
    - Ansible
    - Docker
    - hapi.js
    - Helm
    - Jenkins
    - Kubernetes
    - Node.js
    - MongoDB
    - Prometheus

  project: Migrating existing applications and services onto Kubernetes
  time:
    from: 11/2016
    to: 02/2017
  description: |
    Managing a heterogeneous environment of microservices on AWS with an raising number of applications was becoming increasingly uncomfortable
    for the client’s devops team. Parts of the stack were using different deployment pipelines and instrumentation. We gradually replaced the
    setup with Kubernetes, which gave us a better saturation of hardware resources and greatly improved observability and scalability.

    The new standardized build setup also helped us to create and deploy services more reliably.
  tasks:
    - Creation of a continuous integration / deployment workflow
    - Revision of the container-based infrastructure
    - Migration of existing applications to Kubernetes clusters
    - Development of internal DevOps tools
  techstack:
    - AWS
    - Codeship
    - Docker
    - ELK stack
    - Kubernetes

  project: Creating of an international aviation B2B marketplace
  time:
    from: 03/2015
    to: 11/2016
  description: |
    This was one of the rare opportunities to create an innovative new product completely from scratch. Analyzing typical (still mostly analog) workflows in
    air cargo sector and creating a unique B2B marketplace for optimizing cargo routes and avoiding empty leg flights. Offering easy flight and cargo
    management for airline brokers to help them with their daily work.
  tasks:
    - Technical concept, product and feature development
    - Software architecture and implementation
    - Setup of Continuous Deployment pipeline and initial monitoring
  techstack:
    - AWS
    - CircleCI
    - Docker
    - ELK stack
    - Grafana
    - hapi.js
    - InfluxDB
    - MongoDB
    - Node.js
    - Rancher

  project: Turning a big fashion online store from monolith to microservice
  time:
    from: 05/2014
    to: 12/2014
  description: |
    Having a monolithic, highly customized online store makes it hard to adapt quickly to new business needs. Changes often took weeks to implement and
    test because of the complex code base. Carefully, we singled out parts which could be turned into independent Node.js microservices.
    All of the customer facing web front-end was rewritten as modular and responsive code as well.
  tasks:
    - Front-end/back-end development
    - RESTful API development
    - Web performance and image optimization
    - Consulting
  techstack:
    - CircleCI
    - Express
    - hapi.js
    - MongoDB
    - Node.js
